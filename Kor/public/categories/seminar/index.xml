      <description>Korean Heatwaves and Their Association with Large-scale Atmospheric Circulation Patterns 
Prof. Myong-In Lee (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) 2018/3/20 (Tuesday) 16:00 Science Hall #553 
Abstract Heatwave is a natural disaster with prolonged hot weather lasting for a few days or even longer than a few weeks, increasing mortality and heat diseases, as well as many harmful impacts on property loss and daily lives. As the global mean temperature increases especially in recent years, many regions in the globe are suffering from more frequent development of heatwaves and tropical nights with unprecedented intensity during warm season.</description>

## 1. Overview

Atmospheric Sciences present the challenges of a wide variety of problems of compelling scientific interest and increasing social relevance.
This is exemplified by the current concern over Planet Earth and Global Change, including issues regarding the demand for reliable weather forecast, climate change, the ozone layer, the attempt to control air pollution, precipitation enhancement against water shortage the management of our limited natural resources, and the expanding frontiers to ocean, arctics, and space.
For this purpose the state-of-the-art technologies such as supercomputers and satellites play a critical role for the research and education in Atmospheric Sciences.
The Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Yonsei University is the leading institute in these research areas of utmost interests support for these highly demanding but productive research comes from various sources such as the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Korea Meteorological Administration and the Ministry of Environment among others.  

Atmospheric Science is a discipline that aims to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena that occur in the atmosphere, such as weather and climate, and their relations to ocean, earth surface, and biosphere.
Necessarily application of the knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology is required for a proper assessment of atmospheric phenomena.
Tools of investigation include in situ measurements and laboratory experiments, remote sensing of the global environment, theory developments, and numerical experiments.
Recent developments of innovative measuring instruments, advancement of satellite and radar technologies, developments of more sophisticated and reliable numerical models that describe atmospheric and oceanic movements and enhancement of computing power has expanded the scope of atmospheric science beyond the traditional realm of weather forecasting.
Atmospheric science is now recognized as the scientific discipline that can provide a solution to the fundamental problems of the global environment that we face today such as global warming, air pollution, ozone holes, extreme weather and climate events, and more.


## 2. History

The origin of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Yonsei University was first established in 1968 as the Department of Astronomy and Meteorology.
In 1998 the atmospheric science fields were separated to establish the current department. Now 10 regular faculty members that cover all major fields of atmospheric sciences work hard in education and research in collaboration with other research staffs and also play a major role in domestic and international activities in atmospheric science related fields.
Alumni of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Yonsei University are working at Korea Meteorological Administration and other government organizations, various research institutes and universities around the world, high schools, weather related industries, broadcasting companies, and many others.

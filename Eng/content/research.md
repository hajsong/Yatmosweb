#### Cloud Pysics Laboratory [(http://cloud.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://cloud.yonsei.ac.kr)

In the Cloud Physics Laboratory, we make measurements of physical/chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distributions, cloud droplet and precipitation drop distributions. Also investigated are the implications of these properties on cloud and precipitation developments and aerosol direct and indirect effects using a convective cloud model, an LES cloud model and a mesoscale model. Main areas of interest include warm rain initiation problem, aerosol direct and indirect effects, CCN-precipitation efficiency relationships, cloud seeding, and fog microphysical processes.

#### Climate Theory Laboratory [(http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/climate)](http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/climate)

We are seeking the principal mechanisms on the past, present, and future climate variability and change. Major research concerns involve understanding of the earth climate changing mechanism from the pale-climate to the future climate, and of the intraseasonal-to-multi-decadal variability.

#### Laboratory for Atmospheric Modeling Research [(http://lamor.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://lamor.yonsei.ac.kr)

We investigate the mechanism of severe weather such as Changma, heavy rainfall, typhoon and heavy snowfall to improve forecasts of these phenomena. Understanding and forecasting of severe weather has become an increasingly important issue as more meteorological disasters have occurred recently. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is essential tool for severe weather research. On-going researches of our group are development of numerical model to improve predictability of severe weather and research on mechanism using numerical modeling and observational data.

#### Atmospheric Radiation Laboratory [(http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/oasis)](http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/oasis)

Main focus is on the observation of atmospheric radiative energy and monitoring of ozone layer under the framework of GAW, in this laboratory. Active participation in satellite remote sensing project includes the retrieval of aerosol optical properties from COMS and satellite application projects at Korea Aerospace Research Institute.

#### Laboratory for Atmospheric Dynamics [(http://atmosdyn.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://atmosdyn.yonsei.ac.kr)

We have investigated the dynamics of atmospheric gravity waves generated by convective systems and developed their parameterization for the large-scale models. Also we have examined the wave induced severe downslope windstorms and turbulence through observational, theoretical, and numerical modeling approaches.

#### Atmospheric Predictability & Data Assimilation Laboratory [(http://apdal.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://apdal.yonsei.ac.kr)
In APDAL, inherent predictability of weather and climate, model and data assimilation systems, and adaptive observations are studied to improve the quality of numerical weather prediction. In addition, we also study dynamical development of forecast error and high impact weather systems using observations, models, and various theories Including potential vorticity thinking.

####  Biometeorology Laboratory [(http://koflux.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://koflux.yonsei.ac.kr)
The biometeorology laboratory pursues (1) a nationwide sustainable water resource management with "HydroKorea II" project through the synergy of ecohydrological/ biogeochemical measurement, modeling and remote sensing, and (2) carbon cycle monitoring and prediction in Monsoon Asia through CarboEastAsia, a research cluster based on collaborations in carbon flux researches among China, Japan and Korea.

####  Numerical Modeling Laboratory [(http://nml.yonsei.ac.kr)](http://nml.yonsei.ac.kr)
Main focus is on the development of various numerical models that describe a closed set of appropriate physical laws of the atmosphere in mathematical terms. The practical application is on the improvement of predictability from short-,medium-long range forecasts. For research tool, the model is used to identify the dynamical/thermodynamical characteristics of various atmospheric phenomena such as high-impact weather, abnormal climate, monsoon, and climate change.

#### Atmospheric Remote Sensing Laboratory [(http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/aremote)](http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/aremote)
Our research focuses on satellite remote sensing of clouds and precipitation that are key components in the global water and energy cycles. Current research aims to develop precipitation retrieval algorithms for various microwave, visible and infrared sensors. Our research also involves the use of spaceborne- and ground-based observations and cloud-radiative transfer models to understand radiative and physical characteristics of precipitation systems. The other research area includes satellite mission planning and applications of remotely-sensed data to climate study.

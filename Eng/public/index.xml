      <description>In the Cloud Physics Laboratory, we make measurements of physical/chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distributions, cloud droplet and precipitation drop distributions. Also investigated are the implications of these properties on cloud and precipitation developments and aerosol direct and indirect effects using a convective cloud model, an LES cloud model and a mesoscale model. Main areas of interest include warm rain initiation problem, aerosol direct and indirect effects, CCN-precipitation efficiency relationships, cloud seeding, and fog microphysical processes.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Atmospheric Sciences present the challenges of a wide variety of problems of compelling scientific interest and increasing social relevance. This is exemplified by the current concern over Planet Earth and Global Change, including issues regarding the demand for reliable weather forecast, climate change, the ozone layer, the attempt to control air pollution, precipitation enhancement against water shortage the management of our limited natural resources, and the expanding frontiers to ocean, arctics, and space.</description>
